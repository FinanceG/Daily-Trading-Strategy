# Daily-Trading-Strategy
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a strategy that analyzes daily financial data, predicts market trends, and provides recommendations for potential trades. Using Python, this project integrates data retrieval, cleaning, visualization, and strategy implementation to simulate real-world trading scenarios.

Key Features
Data Collection: Uses financial APIs to pull real-time and historical market data for analysis.
Data Cleaning: Implements data preprocessing techniques to ensure clean, accurate data for modeling.
Visualization: Utilizes libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing market trends, correlations, and strategy performance.
Trading Strategy Implementation: Developed algorithms based on financial models to generate trade signals.
Risk Analysis & Performance Metrics: Evaluates strategy performance through risk-adjusted returns and other financial metrics.
